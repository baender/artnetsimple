# ArtNetSimple

ArtNetSimple is a lightweight library that brings ArtNet protocol support to Arduino-like platforms. Designed with flexibility in mind, this library allows you to dynamically switch between different network interfaces (e.g., from WiFi to Ethernet) during runtime—making it a versatile choice for modern ArtNet projects. 

Currently, the library is in its early stages of development and has been tested primarily on the ESP32 platform. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help expand its functionality and compatibility.
